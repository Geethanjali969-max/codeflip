            <p>A block-level element always starts on a <span style="color:blue;font-weight:bold;">new line</span>and takes up the full width available
                An inline element does not start on a new line and it only takes up as much width as necessary
                The <div> element is a block-level element and is often used as a container for other HTML elements
                The <span> element is an inline container used to mark up a part of a text, or a part of a document
